## Networking

### Protocols

Structure of protocol:

- Syntax
  - Format of the protocol messages
  - At low level: analog signals, currents, voltages
  - High level: fields with data
- Semantics
  - Meaning of messages
  - Behavior of the protocol
- Temporization
  - Time evolution of protocol (ex. time length of signal)
  - Timings (ex. timeout)

## Network structure

→ Edge: hosts (clients, servers) and servers in datacenters

→ Core: interconnected routers, network of networks

Interconnected by **access networks**: wired and wireless communication links
