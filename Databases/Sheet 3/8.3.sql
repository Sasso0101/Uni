-- Now, either use the view we created or create a new one that includes the region for each country. Using this view,
-- - list the countries alphabetically (all of them now, no LIMIT),
-- - include the region, if any, for each country,
-- - modify the ranking to be within each countryâ€™s regions instead of globally
-- Ignore companies: only consider the countries, their regions, and the total amount spent
